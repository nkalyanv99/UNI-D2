Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said that the GOP Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) was essentially booted by his colleagues over the weekend after he shouted out President Obama for granting the “keep and bear arms” to any state with an armed militia.

But Paul said today he doesn’t think Lee’s comments are qualified as an endorsement by the NRA (N).

“He’s trying to take this out of Congress,” explained the Kentucky senator to CNBC, adding that he was a presidential hopeful only to now become a star of his own party. “I guess he was right that he’s going to shut down the NRA, in spite of the NRA before he holds it together.”

For his part any endorsement from the National Rifle Association would serve to further cement their credibility.

It was not “unprecedented” for a senator to make public endorsements, the senator said. “I don’t think this guy’s going to spend a whole day talking about defending our rights.”

“Mike Lee is going to candidly, talk about things that he doesn’t see doing.

“We never met with the Greens on the 'double taxation' plan,” Mr Abbott said on Tuesday night.

Although he has been criticised for engaging the Greens at the hands of the Coalition, he openly acknowledged that such concessions were absent from his major economic policy speech in which he declared there was “no credible alternative” to Labor’s “emphasis on on carbon.”

The Greens, if it were in the coalition, announced its disassociation from Mr Turnbull in protest at Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull refusing to support the prime minister’s position on the issue.

A spokeswoman for the Greens confirmed the party was no longer hostile to official policy.

“We are not the ALP as of today and neither are we in government in the absence of Malcolm Turnbull and our opposition colleagues as ministers,” the spokeswoman said.

“We have challenged, in today's speech, the Greens’ stance on the economy and we are not negotiating with them about our economic policy either today or next week.

“Given the current economic conditions, and the likelihood of a continuing recovery, we will and will continue to maintain our commitment to their policy as we negotiate into this

It is not exhaustive, and very deep with elements, but one important thing is in there is the fact that this game made life so simple, it is focused on what I would have been able to do, what I could do on the fly, or what not I could do. The fact that the game debuted, in my opinion, with this aspect of the game made it a bit more straightforward, but the aspect of this game my highlight amongst me and the living one, is the roleplaying mode game mode.

That’s the aspect of the game that allows the player to see both the hero and the villain in action.

As always coach, Pete Carroll walked the plank when he was asked about the Seahawks defense coming off a disastrous season.

He spoke of a losing record that translates to a disappointing 3-5 finish, with no chance to replacing Jimmy Graham as the starter in this season.

Sound familiar?

“I talk about a really good defense. I just think that’s the kind of defense that they are talking about,” Carroll said Wednesday night during his first public comments since the lockout. “That’s what they’re talk about.

“If you played a decent defense, what would that be?”

Yes, he said, that sort of defense to aim for after another disappointing season that, well, actually finished 3-5. But in reality, like a good defense, he’s more confident that his unit can continue to address the weaknesses-picture problem.

Last year’s All-Star Game featured some super bros, the OG George was a roll, that’s true of the star player, and Chris Paul was a steal though.

Most of us you remember Paul. He was a brutal pick-and-roll player getting his hands on the ball, but after Chris finally put blocks on the court, Paul again, did his best to get much damn space where he was able to shoot.

Without some of the best players on the team, Chris George is somewhat of a for the front. Even, Chris Paul is hard work now with the spotlight. As Paul was in his prime years, the only 3 players to be named the greatest 3 in NBA history were Jackson, James, and now George. While they would go on to 4 NBA Championships, George, was never able to land anywhere near lists of NBA’s great super bros.

Chris Paul is in the prime, and is blessed with the rare trait of being the greatest team player in the history of the legendary Bulls.

(CNN) -- A weekend marked by many: There were dozens of shootings and no homicides this weekend, the FBI and AAA released statistics on Monday.

Florida’s sheriff's department reported the number of shootings this weekend as 63, including five shootings. None were reported on weekends night in Tampa, and only one reported homicide.

According to AAA, three homicides occurred in Florida, including two in St. Petersburg, and five were injured locally.

South Florida and the St. Petersburg metro area also had no homicides reported this weekend.

AAA did not release a homicide in the city during the same period as the weekend before.

Overall, four people have been killed in St. Petersburg this year during the city’s 90-hour lockdown, below what AAA says is normal homicide rates.

There were 10 fewer fatal shootings in the city heading into Saturday and into Monday.

There were 46 shootings this weekend in Jacksonville, 59 in Tampa and 16 in downtown St. Petersburg. Another 12 incidents were reported, including one drive-by shooting late Saturday.

We had a successful season, we have a positive campaign and our goal is getting in the playoffs for the first time in 20 years. Still, a sense of pride will build up early in the season.

We’ve had a difficult camp and were thrown into the goal mix as we learned from our mistakes in the preseason. We think that means we’ve got a decent team and got them at the right stage. Here are thoughts on our starting group.

Victor Wilson remains my favourite. He’s an experienced keeper who performed well on the back nine during preseason with Fury FC. He was most of Saturday’s game in full and after getting injured in the first half, it did not count for Ottawa.

It did take time for Wilson to be healthy, to get between 60 and 90 minutes and he was one of the first players in the front nine. Having an injury, we had to fine tune most of the first month of the season.

There’s plenty to learn from Victor Wilson’s squad

Labour is moving forward with a “tough” look at Budget Responsibility, according to the party’s shadow health secretary.

Former health minister Andy Burnham, who resigned from the party in mid-December, said that the spending targets put forward by health secretary Jeremy Hunt’s Budget Responsibility strategy, which excludes the Olympics and the launch of vocational training at Stansted this summer, will take a significant hit on long-payers and deserve the least oversight.

“The ORS asked me to create a rigorous model, based between 2017-18 and 2035, on where NHS funding should be targeted and whether or not the long-18 target is appropriate,” he wrote on Thursday.

“My response is to look at this by asking if the target – ‘below’ what we have already set out in Budget Responsibility as I carry out long term work – lacks some certainty, and also whether more certainty should be reasonable by 2035, given economic forecasts. In short, there is some uncertainty about those figures and I do not agree with Mr Hunt’s version of the spending target.”

So no the game was good enough. Manchester United delivered a decent performance against Sweden over Thursday. The Dutch were unbeaten in the group stage on Tuesday and after scoring a draw, their loss to Russia a 4-0, red card for toothless diving, Louis van Gaal failed to thrash Holland 3-0. United were ruthless, came under great pressure and only capable of attacking in France's penalty box.

Earlier in the half, Ferdinand had scored a well-timed late goal for the Belgian and went out of his way to bring the game to score United.

United did a good job holding firm in most areas but went deeper, kept a header off the crossbar and held away from the game.

In the second half against Holland, they showed again that they can be very composed when pressing.

There was not a lot of movement or there was little in the box and they were very happy with play in the penalty area whether they got a goal from it or not, they could not get the ball in them and simply wanted to maintain possession.

NASHVILLE -- A homeowner has 15 days to provide the help needed to defend himself against a U.S. federal investigation that dates back at a burglary.

Wednesday, Magisterial Circuit Judge Sharon Higgins granted a temporary stay of the homeowner's bail but says after the decision the stay of stay is 15 days.

Higgins didn't rule out that 15 days is enough reason to warrant or pay for a search warrant moving forward in the investigation.

“Considering there is a plethora of behind-the-scenes allegations to those with issues, and I believe today will be the 15th day in this search.”

The counties where the homeowner lives are Grayson County, Davidson County and Clark County.

KCTV reports that Robinson, 39, stole his younger brother’s car, forced the keys out and used a moped in order to escape. He asked for cell phones and even, some of the time, phones that the homeowner used during the burglary.

“In time past the police would dial 911, and tell the accused homeowner, let him know he had access to and access a device, and kind of suck data off his phone and masturbate when he calls. If he was still out

Eastern Europe, which became its biggest creditor during the collapse of Communism, and lost many industries, is now sharing less than half of its wealth with the rest of the world, the Federal Bureau of Statistics said in its latest economic forecast, published Thursday.

The bureau has released an annual series of global median wealth figures for the past four years, most of which have focused on determining how distribution of wealth across individual countries has affected U.S. prosperity worldwide.

The biggest divergence in inequality was the stark gulf where people live in the U.S. — which has the largest proportion of net worth living in the world today. Today, the gap between the countries is greater for the bottom 20 percent of Americans, compared to the top 20 percent of the U.S., the bottom 40 percent of Europe, Australia, China, and the rest of Europe.

Indeed, the top 20 countries in the OECD don’t appear as equal when we peeled away the aggregate wealth of the richest countries: the U.S., Britain, New Zealand and Singapore.

It’s Porter destined to do as a Portland defender over all five-and-a-half years: if he takes a chance in MLS, there will be plenty of the one chance the Timbers get.

The opener against the Seattle Sounders was a 2-2 draw, and the Timbers’ defense was no exception. Like other parts of the season, it’s been a close game with the Timbers focused strictly on being in possession.

And yet on some lighthearted note, it’s been rough.

“We had a passing game, but we at least played our defense well,” Porter said.

Seattle lost twice and the Portland teams, but it’s a passing game. You can will accept what that means, have you?

You must admit it eventually.

Indeed, Porter noted during our getting-on-the-phone conversation Saturday how Portland’s defense sputtered miserably leading Seattle to play behind, even in the second half when Portland’s cut-backs were fine. None.

MANCHESHAM, England – Arsenal backed their new Emirates boss Arsene Wenger, following the surprise £42.3m transfer agreed for Olivier Giroud before the FIFA World Cup in France on Sunday morning.

The 24-year-old is the only young French player in the U-23 squad to still hold international status but is expected to secure a move for the Gunners.

“Of course I do not want to sell him. We will not sell him,” Wenger told the Arsenal Times. “He has worked hard every day since joining me. He is a footballer who can play for us and for the first team.”

However, despite the lack of top-quality centre-backs in their squad plus £50million marksman Virgil van Dijk, said Arsenal should not be concerned, stating Wenger and friends are pushed for a move in the summer.

Newcastle made the biggest splash of this summer transfer window, snapping up the former Southampton player in a deal that that would have allowed the club to buy Daniel Sturridge in the summer of 2015, without having any clause for a buyback for their signings or starlets in the summer.

The motion was made this morning by House Republicans, two Republicans who already watered down the amendment in the House to soften their stance on passing funding and oppose it.

The amendment’s cuts are reportedly up to $300 million per 100 US Dollars, according to the Politico. The main notable are the cuts in Defense spending and the government’s domestic discretionary programs such as aid to the military. Although the cuts are broad in scope, they also affect the funding of the Secretary of Homeland Security’s fiscal 2017 budget, forcing a vote on whether it’s off to the House of Representatives. The amendment would also require an element to the budget designated for the president and limit the president’s ability to both discretionary agencies and military operations controlled by Congress.

Dan Rooney, of the Steelers, says: “I’m staying in Charlotte. It’s time to remind you that we’re not your team, we’re fans.

When we went to Pittsburgh, we invited all your fans to come and see the games they wanted to see. They had stirring games, but we gave away everything for our people to see. So we a) learned learned the lessons of that, and b) learned the lesson of noise. Now it’s time for you guys to stop aying away. I’m going to urge you to come out and continue to be a little bit louder.

There’s also this thing we’ve talked about. They’re not going to be able to watch at least all of those games. Maybe they don’t care. But for the rest of the year, that’s going to be what we do. We played a little different last year. Our group changed. It goes on. In the eight weeks here, they’re screaming, they’re passing the ball, they’re running the ball. They’re going to play against different teams, be

ALBANY, N.Y. -- Police officers crossed a quiet street in a West Troy neighborhood Wednesday evening before they were called to a drive of assault rifles.

Around 11 p.m. just after midnight, officers saw a group of men with a stolen gun to get out of a car and followed the group to a vehicle.

Officers also found two men inside a car holding several dozen guns, police said. One man was in the trunk of the car. A cell phone was also found in the car.

The trunk of the car was eventually closed, but police say that the car was unlocked at the time.

The driver’s license and the gun were then found inside.

Police said several teens were also in the trunk of the car and headed to the Albany County jail.

The teens, apparently texting another teen that his location was not right, hopped into the back of the car and drove out to relative safety.

The stereo was located in front of the weapons and men.

Police said a female officer then attempted to remove the two men from the car. The men struggled, but when the teens lost their weapons, a female officer opened up her gun and attempted to run away
