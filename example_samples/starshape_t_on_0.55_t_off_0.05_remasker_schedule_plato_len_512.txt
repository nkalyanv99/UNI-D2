Police investigate shooting was alleged domestic dispute over drugs discharged

A statement has been made that a man who is in stable condition has been discharged from an ambulance after shooting over a dispute over a emergency control line and a passenger.

Police said the incident saw ambulance service staff ignore a number of directions to prohibit the right of “medical discharge” by ambulance crew.

Addressing the constable, Sir Mark said staff in the Cardiff ambulance service were aware that, as a result, the limits of “medical discharge were exceeded” and that the driver of an ambulance and passenger were both treated and discharged on the scene.

Sir Mark said the ambulance service had concluded the shooting was a “domestic dispute” and requested that Metropolitan Police be called.

He said: “Ambulance protocol was followed by Metropolitan police to indicate that the discharge was “not at risk.”

“Two passengers and the driver of an ambulance received ‘not at risk’ orders.”

The police constable, Kate Bradshaw, who was at the scene when two customers were shot in Cardiff’s Chead area, said: “Our staff have been advised that if there are their safety issues of concern, they should be discharged.

“It has been indicated that there will be a police investigation in this connection with the incident.”

Sir Mark also said that the shooting was “a very serious incident” and it was not the result of a “domestic conflict” with other members.

Of the passengers, Sir Mark said: “A man has been discharged from the central ambulance ambulance.”

“Other crew members have discharged.”

A spokesman for the ambulance service said a passenger and an unnamed member of the central ambulance and ambulance crew were both taken from an ambulance to South University Hospital on Sunday morning.

A man, despite being injured at the scene, was released from the emergency room, while a woman and another woman, suspected, were released an hour later.

There was no police presence at the scene, and a spokesman for the ambulance service said the two passengers are in stable condition.

“During an initial inspection, the central ambulance and crew confirmed that they had customers onboard who were able to disembark, as well as passengers and ambulance crew,” the ambulance spokesman said.

“I think you do have to need the space more. I’m not sure I’m agree with that,” Sen. Mark Warner said, adding that he didn’t think the desks should have been in two rooms or in the hallway. “But, the desk should not be above the hallway. It should be above the table.”

Update: The AP story puts a good spin on it.A father and gay wife have told their story about accidentally killing their son, Liam, and mother, Jennifer Soler.

Lawrence Soler is a married man, and with that second child and wife at home, this weekend Liam went to the Philippines on a whim. The trip had been a beautiful experience but he had to take his distraught son, Liam, back home.

Liam is a gay marriage - a marriage of the wife and the husband, rather than a husband and wife, the marriage she is a father and son - he is a father and son."

As he explained when his son killed Liam and raped him, Liam had to tell his sister Jennifer who was responsible for the son whom he said had been there to mourn.

Within five minutes, Liam was dead and after watching his sister cry, he saw his mother lying on the floor.

"Shut up! I'm talking to you," he yelled Jennifer. Liam later apologised.

He then turned to Jennifer and found his wife standing next to him but unable to speak.

"She doesn't understand what she says to me. I mean, do you think she's just back with me? I don't think she knows what's going on."

Lawrence and wife Liam went to the Philippines, seeing it was a hot spot for gay men.

CNN asks GOP’s Clinton: he’s better

NEW YORK – Michelle Obama, the former Obama’s first lady and presidential candidate, said Donald Trump that can lead the people to success and change the world should serve as president of the United States.

“From what I can see Donald Trump is a man who cannot lead. He’s not a leader. He is not a leader of the people. What do we choose? It’s got to be somebody that we have to choose.”

Hillary Clinton expressing her belief that the U.S. President is Obama said "he is a man has led this country to success and achieved great things in the world."

She added "he is a man who can lose power to anyone but he is a man who is stronger. If you know him, if you look in the mirror for a moment he is stronger and he's stronger."

Barack Obama doesn’t think Donald Trump should run again.

The Democratic nominee was asked by CNN for her opinion on President Obama in case he gets a bid for third term. She said she would like to have known the country he lives in.

Clinton says "we have not followed his policies in the U.S. like any other country," but she notes that Obama has "had a open borders policy and he has a lot of countries following it."

"The way I see it, the U.S. has very open border, very open borders, and he sees the same things that the U.S. or any other country that we have to live in."

She said she knows Donald Trump far from in the U.S. but that she does understand that he is "a businessman and he loves his country and soited would pay no taxes."

Clinton said she is not going to take President Obama’s position on free trade or fair trade.

But, she said, "one thing I do understand is he certainly values his country, which is my core values. And so I don't think there's any different from that where we are not in terms of values because we have the same values."

Clinton says that she has the ability to oppose Donald Trump and but willing to concede defeat and support him to live in the future.

ochester Mayor Tom King is taking any crisis calls today when reporters come out swinging what he calls a crisis call.

As Rochester Republicans all over the mayor’s city this, it was not, asking for him to update his policy when it comes to big problems, King said he will not be taking a crisis call today.

The Mayor told reporters he is not taking a presidential campaign-style crisis call.

“I mean, what’m I gonna say?” the Mayor said, when asked about why he refused to make a call again today.

We want to hear about a plan to deal with the problems facing Rochester.

“Yes I’m taking it,” King said at Rochester City Hall on Wednesday afternoon. “I’m going to take it to the hall and put it on the side of the street.”

Part two: Rochester Mayor Tom King on Rochester crisis call.

King said he did a no crisis call, answered the one’s questions without saying a single plan.

“I talked very directly, directly with the city about wanting to solve the major problems in Rochester,” King said.

King also said Rochester will try to use crisis calls as a stage for a series of crisis calls.

“I haven’t heard a plan. I’ve never heard a plan. That’s what a lot of people have said happened,” the Mayor said, “and I’ve never heard anything remotely like a plan.”

House reporters asked King whether he doesn’t have the time to answer that — yes, I do — King said he’ll take.

The Mayor said a crisis call is one that takes a reasonable amount of time for a mayor to answer.

King said he met with both the mayor and former chairman of the commission after the general election last month and said they had a list of problems that need addressing.

“I I reached out to the chairman of the commission and he says I’m taking a crisis call,” the Mayor told us. “I reached out to help him get it.”

King said one of the first times a crisis call isn’t taken is to let the big problems show why they fight so hard.

 Trump shows emotion (pictured)

Prime Minister Theresa May‘s meeting today with President Trump, in which she shook his hand, was met with emotion, and claims that the so-called Commander-in-Chief has now been more open to a relationship with Britain within the EU than he envisaged.

The Prime Minister had said that the two leaders would only meet once a year for a year – as they do each year – but only meet three times at one time. She said she did not think that was a stretch.

The pair had not shown any signs of emotion today as well.

… Mr Trump at the ladies’ dinner organised with his wife Theresa May this morning explained how he believes the country is in the EU, because of its President being Irish.

“You do not represent Ireland, you represent the United Kingdom” he said.

Mr Trump said said that the British “believe in us and have a big ambition” to root out terrorism within the EU if it’s possible.

“We’re gonna be much stronger for that,” he said, according to the Financial Times.

“We’ll get stronger.”

… In an interview with The Daily Times this morning Mr Trump said: “We have a lot of interests of ours, one of which is we get stronger globally and in the rest of the world we can become stronger and we can do better.”

Mrs May said she still will reveal despite signing off on her relationship with her husband in response to Britain’s laws banning the pair from taking pictures at official events.

“I’ll continue to take pictures and not worry about the notion that ‘I take pictures’ means anything,” she said according to the Sun.

Mrs May is due to be visiting with Donald Trump tomorrow, and the Prime Minister reiterated that the pair have a “great relationship,” according to Politico.

… But Mrs May, in turn did not make clear when the visit would be with the President, according to Politico. The New York Times also said it had been informed of Trump’s plans for the meeting.

… Mr Trump tweeted: “You know, you and I have an amazing relationship, this is what we want as a country. After years of failing badly I want to come back strong and prosper.”

More than 1,000 supporters waited in Tel Aviv Saturday night to recognize the occupied Old City that will become Israel’s capital, reported Haaretz.

The weekly Jerusalem Post reported early Saturday morning that another 4,500 were present, each standing in the streets. Their number was not immediately known.

The decision comes at a time of tensions between foreign governments over positions on Jerusalem.

Prime Minister Netanyahu said declaring the city as its own, regardless of the official boundaries of the city in east Jerusalem is “necessary for the security of the state."

“When the number of Jews living in Jerusalem reached 2 million, it makes no surprise that our government recognizes its capital yet,” he said in a statement. “After all, since the establishment of our country in 1948, Jews have maintained control of their land, regardless of the borders laid down in 1967 and 1967 borders.”

“By refusing to declare Jerusalem a capital, we seek to divide it from the Jews who inhabited Jerusalem. Even without recognizing Jerusalem as a capital, there are some Jews laying claim to it.”
Avigdor Lieberman also condemned Israel’s announcement, and called it “a pretext on which every Arab criticism against Israel is based.”

‘The greatest capital in the world waiting’

The rally was attended by Israel’s Palestinian nationalist MK Hayat Rabin who spoke against the Jerusalem decision to Palestinians not “recognizing their land.”

"We need to recognize the Palestinian territories, which is part of the state and does not include Jerusalem, as part of the borders of the state. The reason is simple, in contrast to the attempts made in the two-state solution," he told the Jerusalem Post, to loud cheers.

“We have to give Israel a definition in international law if it is achieveable, for we declare the city an international capital,” explained Rabin.

Evan Reitz, member of Knesset and member of the opposition also voiced his support for the Ministry of Justice. He attended Saturday’s demonstration, to voice the sentiment, that he expects for a decision before a general elections.

 in the gallery.WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democrat Bill Clinton on Wednesday said he could secure a majority of pledged delegates from the major party by the end of the year and prodded people to support a run for president in each state.

While she remained the front runner in the closest contest between the Democratic and Republican parties since June election, she had pulled off a last-way race to retain the presumptive Democrat as her party’s U.S. nominee.

The Obama campaign now has a majority of pledged delegates from states of congressional District 4 and 8 in the north coast as well as urban areas and has the delegates needed to win California.

“Senator and candidate has has to begin work to stand up to the U.S. president, given the high-profile endorsements of the Democratic and Republican parties. Votes are at stake here,” Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the chairwoman of the local Democratic Party.

“And on top of that, he’s also had to work with young people - African-Americans, younger voters - whose participation has sharply increased and who are willing to submit to the push from the progressive forces in each state.”

Clinton has superdelegates - party insiders who have been excluded from the process of voting and party leadership role and until the party decides to nominate a candidate for the nomination by the end of June.

In California Sanders has delegates needed to, as any U.S. presidential candidate would have to do, one of the 247 delegates needed for the general election.

Sanders has a majority of delegates in states but all of them from those states - 19 of them - - neither pledged or pledged general election delegates in either party

“We’re trying our hardest to show the people of California that he’s authentic, not a hero to the American people, they have to win California,” Wasserman added.

Tara Sandhaler, executive director of the California Coalition for Progressive Change, vowed in a statement to welcome a “welcome plea” from “tens of committed California Democrats” to unite behind their party’s nominee and resist the Clinton campaign “by into the general election of October.”

According to national polls, Sanders is statistically favored to defeat Clinton in the California primary and he has most of the Golden State’s 99 delegates delegates.

The Democratic and Republican parties need 100 delegates to win

Philip Hammond, Treasury secretary says Labour will attempt to change his views to unite membership Read more

The chancellor who has been heavily criticised for his lack of support has said he is open to voting for his successor, even if his so may split the party’s members.

And the former minister of finance, Philip Hammond, said in his speech that Labour would be open to voting for Jeremy Corbyn while he also tried to change his mind to unite the party membership behind him.

But Labour’s general secretary Vince Cable, who will decide within two weeks who is his party’s leader, said if he listened to members he would still stand by his decision.

Mr Hammond concluded his speech by declaring to the London Times that Corbyn does not listen to the Labour Party’s views.

“That is because he doesn’t listen to his political beliefs and doesn’t listen to those who support Jeremy and everyone inside the party,” he said.

Mr Hammond, who was initially initially reluctant to back Corbyn following his ouster from cabinet last month, said that Labour was open to listening if he wanted to change his position.

“Jeremy is a politician who listens to all of the constituents. I think Labour is going to listen to the membership’s views and therefore support Jeremy,” he said.

“I’m very much supportive of the Labour Party’s member, but I would also like to listen to the views of Jeremy and everyone within the party,” he said.

“I do want to clarify it, and I start, as said before, by making up my mind,” he added.

UK Prime Minister David Cameron will "work peacefully and efficiently" with US President Donald Trump, Russian officials say

WASHINGTON, Ria Novosti, November 20, 2017 (AFP) - Donald Trump is still "writing and answering questions" as he prepared for a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, officials said.

Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov met Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron ahead of Donald Trump's first officially-designated visit to Washington.

Vladimir Putin praised David Cameron shortly prior to the meeting, saying Donald Trump is "very good for the values" and from what America still has to learn, Russian media reported.

Russian and British governments have agreed that normal diplomatic relations with leaders, including meetings between presidents and prime ministers, should be conducted in principle.

In an opinion piece published shortly after the meeting by a high-ranking Russian source, according to news agency TASS quoted Putin stating Trump was not listening but explaining but instead be "productive" for US interests.

Putin said Donald Trump had a task ahead: refuse answers.

"I have to say that Donald Trump has to have learned something about democracy, but he has to understand politics. That is the thing that the people expect of him," Putin was quoted quoted by Reuters, quoting senior Russian officials as saying.

"I can say that I believe Donald Trump is good for the values, in my opinion. These are the values that he values him the most and the human society values.

"Yes, he needs a a bit of patience and flexibility. otherwise human society will not accept him. I believe that Donald Trump can play the role as not a blocking person, but a working person.

"Unfortunately he cannot be that. In my view this is important for the interests of all of us and this is important for Russia.

"This is important for the interests of America.

"What he value very much and we can all value is helping these two countries negotiate and move forward based on what we consider to be the US national interest."

And a cryptic message Monday from US Secretary Rex Tillerson said it appeared that the cold period between Donald officials was ending, with the US diplomat added that Washington was "love to have a kind of dialogue" with Britain.

Tillerson, to date, has not shown if such a role, that "We would just love to have it worked out with the best team we can"

 who testified that the first and priority of the driver wasn’t stopping but rather to help continue.

The driver was also advised that there was a passenger in the backseat who touched the man, who had been ordered to stop, not to “stand himself,” his attorney said.

"But you don't stop him or her, right?” Mr. Richard asked.

“I’m sure you don't,” Mr. Rivera replied.

Then Mr. Richard laughed. “Freedom of movement?” Mr. Rivera asked, his voice sharply risen.

“Well, the driver had the right to stop,” Mr. Richard said, and he felt satisfied that the officer had a chance to make his point, which was an important distinction.

“He said we already stopped, right?” he asked, and Mr. Richard was unimpressed, saying “no.”

The driver’s “chase” was an attempt to “get the vehicle to the point where he was going to stop” before crashing into the ground, he said.

Richard assured them that an officer told the driver not only to stop but also to report that he was doing so

"That's part of the job," he added, so “he stopped because of necessity.”

But look, that’s not supposed to be the last word, is it? “Yes, he complied,” she told them, but not giving the officer’s lawyer that last line for insisting that he had initiated a chance to stay in the vehicle.

“Where are handcuffs from? Do you mean deep handcuffs?”

“Yes,” Mr. Rivera answered. “Which is under the hood.”

(Yes, it is handcuffs, she said, because the man’s long arms were “above the hood,” and not because of the driver’s desire to wear a white tights or something. "Of course, not a badge," said Rivera.)​. Your truck has a driver's license, the only.

Sample 23:
A friend of mine, Chris Brown a comedian and fortune teller, said that he thought Ron Paul was a potential Reagan president, if Chris Brown knew who Ron was.

Chris was stated, “I am a Republican, I am gay I would never and will vote against me,” and there was only one gay Republican who voted against Reagan, not against Paul, and there is a gay Republican who is against Paul.

He stated:

“When it comes to the treatment of gays in general, the homosexual treatment of Democrats in general, Chris Brown would not vote against the GOP in general because he thought, was the only gay Republican who said in the past that he was a gay Republican and so gay he would never, ever voted against a block Republican.”

I know what Chris Republican was here, because according to my opinion, I would have thought that he am a gay Republican who Ron and I and every other Republican voted against is Ron.

“What does it mean not, that, closet to me that a Republican or anti-gay Republican, is it meant to be anti-gay Republican or ‘anti-gay’, or something related to that sort of thing?

It leads to my opinion, that is the way the Republican Party treats Chris Brown, that is the only gay Republican who voted against me, there was only one gay Republican in the Legislature, who is facing hearings and being investigated, Chris said

“But I am gay. I know what happens to me, when I tell people I will not vote. This is the same thing. saying you are not sexually attracted to any one kind, and saying that you are not attracted to any kind. You spoke out about sexual attraction outside of the party, and we do not condone that language. The truth is half of all people were born gay and we are born the rest of the gay.”

He has only one gay Republican in the Legislature who voted against me, and they are not gay, but they are a Republican or Chris Brown and every other Republican is a gay Republican who adamantly, does vote against me. He does not and will not vote against and he has 12 straight Republicans who did not and will not vote against.

The truth is that I am a proud gay Republican. My family is a proud Republican, and yet there has not been a gay Republican other than Chris has voted against me who I would have voted for.

Sample 29:
 and mother Ashley Bright, 21, a 20-year-old student at Emory Virginia, filed a lawsuit this week against her school’s program director, dean and dean after accusations were that she was sexually assaulted during her West Virginia University commencement

In court, the mother said that she and dean hit off an email sent by several men who said they had sexually assaulted during her school’s commencement in 2009. Email was presented as evidence to the program director but not the dean by West Virginia’s Civil Liberties Union (WACU) and the Civil Rights Commission, both of which are legal advocacy groups, according to lawsuit.

“One have just sent out an email with this alleged, and there will be nothing yet for complaints!” Bright said in his response to the lawsuit. “And you have been trying this on this semester, as you have gone through all all this!”

According to a letter written by Bright’s mother who filed the lawsuit, at the University of West Virginia there were “credible reports of sexual violence and unwanted touching over an eight-year span” as part of her school.

The letter states the dean specifically sought to explain the situation and how it affected the school financially and made clear that the dean was “freed with the individuals’ actions” and “freed not to create the circumstances, but there was not a lot he could and could not do.”

When emails went to the dean prompting an effort to confront the dean and program director, the dean walked in, said he talked at the school and that the dean wanted “to keep the campus safe by referring you to the faculty.”

The two parties the letter declined to comment.

Another proposer to the lawsuit told The Daily Mail that in regards to the “harmful” emails, the dean “would not specifically address (the [email]) what it was, because he could not confirm”

Another proposer told the Daily Mail “we don't have confirmation to confirm” and added: “It was a private message from an individual.”

The mother of the lawsuit also attributed the email to the dean.

“She didn't know or help write the email. She wrote the email. It was all our fault,” the parent wrote, according to court filings.

The court filing comes after school

New York State has long passed when weed became part of the law, but senators from a New York State are pushing the bill to legalize pot that doesn’t exist.

State Sen. John Alper, D-Larkville, said he had no doubt he would actually changing state law to pot.

“Unfortunately, so many people in my district are pushing the idea, and I will not allow my police department to supply any aspen,” Alper told members of the state Senate Committee on Public Policy. “The fact is, they don’t understood the law, and I’m the precedent of the state Marijuana bill, as well.

“There are a number of situations where it hasn’t been spelled out,” Alper explained. “And it’s not your fault when you say that, ‘I cannot allow the state police to supply other drugs.’”

Alper’s pushing the notion that marijuana is regulated by the state and that should be up to lawmakers. Alper said he’s proposing a law that wouldn’t regulate what residents can buy or sell, nor would collect any tax money from local police departments.

“Cannabis that’s legal there is legal, can go out and go everywhere because the law guarantees that it’s legal,” Alper said when asked why that was legal or what it’s illegal, adding that that depends on where you’re located now and what retailers are selling in the long run. However, he explained, “marijuana is a nice-guy product. It takes it to the marketplace.”

Alper also believes the state’s licensing commissioner should allow an office district in the Nassau County area, where anyone who wants to have legal use or set up an marijuana or wine operation in Nassau can. As of earlier this week, dispensaries in Nassau weren’t large enough to open up an office.

RutgersNews reports the emergence of a story about a sexual assault which took place at MIT. This story which was published has outraged the college as well as the university’s student body, as well as the attention which brought to the newspaper.

The assault took place in the early summer of 2014. Sexual assaults took place in the summer, and continue to occur throughout the fall.

On Saturday evening, a member of MIT’s student body was raped by another student as a result of the sexual assault.

This was on September 1, 2014 after an male student assaulted several of the body, including one of the female victims. The man in the student body, who has since been identified, was hospitalized with injured head and neck, but he later taken to a hospital.

Both the man and woman confessed to the assault.

The Boston Globe reported:

Daniel Gonzalez, 38, used his son’s telephone number to call 911 and report that he was drugged and raped by another student at the University of Massachusetts. “I couldn’t believe that this had happened to my son as well,” he said. “We don’t go to that level as kids. There’s a big shock going on.” There was to be a lot of trauma coming from there. One of the four men was almost fatally shot in the head, he added. “I want to end my whole now,” he said. “Gonzalez said it has impacted him the most. If you look in the mirror now and said: “I told you it’s happened to me,” it’s completely false. I accept this facts and get over it. [Gonzalez] has needed support from not only his mom, but the principal and the campus. “There’s so much trauma going on on the MIT campus, I really want to get out and get over it,” Ruiz said. “He worried about everything, and he will need a lot of support and lot of help from the dorms on them to overcome it.”

The same paragraph and quote beginning with post can be found in the following quote from Seattle in the Wall Street Journal article.

“When it comes to students finding good teachers, a lot of students are not very interested in the art of teaching.” “But one thing that I have realized is that there are many students who would find teaching more interesting. So, it is very important to understand who that student is.”​

A little clarification of the quote from 11/13/2016 now for 3/17/2017

“One thing is they are a really keen learner, and they are always eager to teach. That is so very evident in all of my students. A lot of students are really interesting from time to time when they do stay with me in person. To see me as a teacher, for me, really interesting.”​ \​​— ​ - [Reconstruction of the first sentence]

“It’s not necessarily a blog. It is a blog with a lot of arguments, ‘Gemme put out a blog.’ It’s a space for students who want different things. And, it’s a space for people who want to learn new things. And so it’s for them whether they agree or not. If they agree to participate, if they agree to come to my school, I will show up, I will invite them. And if they don't like it, I will say, ‘You do not like that, so please do not agree.’​​​

UEMON France –

In the beginning of the video, Jono saw Stephanie in an interview with French TV.

In the video Stephanie said that when she first met Jono she had a similar job. He took the office with her and told her, “If I had worked 20 years, that might would have been on your TV.”

Jono then led me up to the front door and showed me a picture.

And he said getting Stephanie interview working at his office, then to Stephana’s setting up a camera for publication?

“It’s been very hard, very hard, very hard it is very difficult to sit in the office in France,” Jono said. “The difficulty is unbelievable. So much time trying to come back to work office it was quite busy.”

In the beginning about the interview, Jono said it was one-on-one to “the most important meetings” on his “big life.” He promised Stephanie the “big life” would start and end after the interview and it would be one-on-one with her husband.

She followed him on Monday and invited him back to the office. And then the night last week he sent to Stephanie a email and he said it was all his fault and he told her the “real life that this tohaiste is living was life.”

Jono also told Stephanie the “big life” would happen the rest of the weekend and he told her that one day if she didn’t believe it then she would wake up with a cold cup of coffee and “no alcohol.”

Jono gave a memorable quote for that as his personal two days of work.

“If it is one day of work I will not work,” he said that Stephanie. “It is exhausting. It’s my day if I do nothing. It is every hour, every day, every night.”

What’s the number? I just told him that he gives one day a week.

“One day is a day to keep my people focused and focused,” he said.

WASHINGTON (AFP) – US President Barack Obama suggested that it’s not so easy to transfer the US presidential office to Trump.

“I just say for myself – what’s it about Putin and not about Trump in one sense or the other?” he asked on Fox News.

“I’m not going to come out and say there’s a fair and easy way to transfer the presidency of the United States to someone who is not advancing our country’s vital interests.”

“The critical issue here is to preserve America’s leadership so we don’t make the kinds of mistakes that the world has,” Obama said.

“That is the key here frankly, because we need to have the kind of international consensus in Washington to hold our leadership in this extraordinary situation threatened by Donald Trump.”

Earlier in June, Obama refused to blame Trump for the president’s attacks of him.

“I think rather than allow somebody to look at their own affairs and how they should manage themselves, we don’t blame Putin for this,” he said.

But Obama said Trump is beating up his country more so than the whole world, even criticizing the attention-seeking president’s actions.

“He needs to work on that platform with Putin. I respect Vladimir Putin. I know who he is and like a bunch of other guys do — but it’s not my personal view, because it’s not my personal.”

Obama did, however, say that an appeal to Putin to put Hillary Clinton at the top of her ticket is not credible, and that it’s U.S.-Russia relations that must be resolved.

Obama also noted that Trump has been “made as the most consequential political figure in the history of the international arena.”

“Trump risks becoming the future president of the United States because of his aggressive conduct,” the former first lady added. “This cannot be continued. We now ourselves in a position where we have to step back and we have to take a principled stand by our Constitution and — together, by our constitutions — we get Russia out of this.”

More important to the administration, Obama said that Trump’s rhetoric is dangerous and is promoting exactly the kind of foreign leaders undermining the U.S.

Moments later, an Ontario friend dragged a man out of trick-or-treats, only to discover she’d learned a lesson. As they played their favorite game at home, Paris waited a couple hours after the game, during which she explained to her friend how he “looked the same despite being a man and a woman.”

“First off,” Paris told her friend, “it didn’t seem different to me and then someone said ‘It’s wrong with your penis that men and women are judging you’ and then another person said it’s wrong with my partner’s penis at least. We were kind, shocked.”

Paris did a legwork and tried and rewrote her friend’s words from that night. And then, she says, she stumbled.

Have you seen someone judgeed by their penis? Share your stories with your friends!

Two years earlier, as a senior at an Ottawa-area training school—a high-class place where everyone is gay—Paris thought the media needed to investigate the way they portrayed it, but Paris thought Ottawa should start an ethics committee. (Paris says she sits on the school’s ethics committee.) The pair has shared turf a couple times, but this is the first time she’s worried.

“Yeah, a lot of people, especially the university. it’s definitely a safe area for people to talk about same-sex marriage. It’s definitely not safe for people to talk about gay people. Maybe that’s a huge shock, especially in my point of view at some point in my life,” she says. “But I haven’t been one point of view that is said that applies to every, sports player or football player or any hockey player. You never hate anyone wants to tell you that way, right?”

There should be skepticism, Paris says. She may have expected some. But she says she’s not afraid to speak about things people might say. And she needs support. But Paris would rather not be so coy about it. She does need help. And Paris has a list of schools and clubs and clubs in the United States. And she hopes someone will get involved.

My boyfriend is going to leave out here.’ He’s like ‘How are you gonna find me? Because she’s going to go with my boyfriend over here now. I have to move her out.”

K recalled, “And I was so scared. She just stood there and texted me. And then she just said, ‘Come [check on her].’ My husband just picked up the phone and laughed.”

​Then Kim said, “Oh no. I really do miss Kim. I really do miss someone who’s my favorite. She she motivates me.” ​

​“How did your boyfriend get there?”

K said, “I had a better boyfriend than Kim’s boyfriend and I moved in with her because I thought soon she would go home. This was my last option and I saw that as my only chance all right.”

When Kim texted Kim next day she said she was like, “I was afraid, so close to afraid than my boyfriend won’t be happy or comfortable for me in this situation, so I have to move in with Kim. He helped me let her to know that she’s been staying with us boyfriend in Korea for the past 2-3 months.”

K said, “Everything was confusing. It never made sense.”

It was still confusing until Thursday night the morning when he texted her 9’clock night and said, “It’s time to move in.”

K replied, “Soon.”

 has given a fiery speech about the party's "vision for Scotland".

The party has repeatedly criticised Ms Sturgeon's decision to quit the UK Government as being in breach of the terms of the UK's treaty.

But events at the weekend have led to simmering tension among both parties. Party leaders believe it has very much lost itself by failing to pay close attention to a policy agenda which Labour has adopted, disconcertingly shunned, and re-branded by itself in New Democrat.

In her fiery address Ms Sturgeon defended the SNP plans to remain, telling voters that all political decisions could go to the courts of justice.

"I believe yes decisions should go to the courts without any legal advice, and that's how you do business," she told people.(AUSTINESVILLE) Let’s face it. The 2016 presidential race is at a new high level that’s much higher than any other US senator. Much higher than Lindsey Graham on George 4.

“Here’s the thing,” Lindsey Graham, who’s running for election to the Senate, is going to say “Here’s the thing: you’re an independent and we’re going to elect someone who is at the top of the ticket.”

If you know him he’s going to tell donors that depend on him are going to hate him, and if they depend on him what is going to say is what they think really is happening in the world for the moment.

“Millions of Americans have maybe not a clue what’s going on in the world world, the policy world, the business world, but I’ve seen them move around the place thinking,” Lindsey Graham said on George 4’s show. “But what I see more for me is what is happening in the world or what extraordinary stuff is happening in the world or stuff that is being said right now has some relevance in the policy world.

“Is it happening or is it not happening? We need to stop saying this that.”

The answer is simple because we may be in the early rounds of the campaign season, that does not mean it has changed what we hear.

Smith said Atkinson can still be considered a potential first pick during the draft.

“Just going through a lot of ups and downs, because of what’s going on,” Smith said. “It doesn’t add up as much a coach having the toughness to handle a situation as it’s the ability to understand it and be the role coach.”

“In a positive way. I met the role coach a couple of times and basically took ownership. It’s a cool opportunity to bring some new experiences to it.

“It’s just a different set of challenges like the role coach, the coach relating to a pro basketball team and everything is different.

“I have overcome adversity a sure. I don’t think it was a tough time, but I feel like I’ll say I never dealt with it alone as a player.

“I’ve definitely felt I had to face some adversity. I think being human it’s there to help you through it, especially if you’re just working through it you still have the ability to kind of accept it and do what right want.

By Jeremy Long

One thing I miss up on is defending against the box defense, but the Mavericks have Harden on defense. James Harden scored 26 points in Game playoffs against the Houston Rockets.

So if the Mavericks or Rockets are dominant, cover that ground.

If you’re at the rim behind the mid post, or on the top of the offensive line, you need to cover up.

The 34-year-old Harden can step out of the hole for you, at Harden, if it’s not possible.

He’s having his best year in the league, but it’s not his fault. The reigning MVP should be playing next to Harden’s starter.

James Harden was in the league a couple of years, but he has not played well this year.

The Rockets would have to get 20 points from him, especially in this playoff game. The difference between the Rockets and Mavericks, on the other hand, could be just 20 points.

Both have weapons.

So the offense, where the guys who can pass need to make cuts, layup, step off the block or run, break. They’re in the same situation which makes sense.

Because the Rockets defense on defense isn’t exactly perfect either.

*Harden just played his first career regular season 3-point game. After scoring a career high 11 from beyond three arc last year,

in the semifinal series between Houston and Dallas, he hit a career-high four 3-pointers

Harden looks in the open court, because his throwers are so effective

*Edit: The defense turned ugly here: When Harden has one man open looks and the 3-point line, there’s supposed to be one blocking the shots. What do you make of that?

Harden blocked three point shots, but three thirds of his misses in the second half.

In Dallas, anytime Harden was behind the arc or cutting to the basket, he was the man sealing it. And anywhere near the 3-point line is the guy who cares if the ball was over the arc or in the basket.

But none of that is relevant.

If James Harden isn’t playing defense this season, Houston is playing defense, and Dallas is playing offense. Anyone can win those games: the Rockets or the Mavericks.

And I don’t

This is one of those pieces of information that needs to be shared. This is the little piece of life where people don’t have the time to know it. But we shared it and people wanted to know it.

Because of that we thought we needed information to be publicly available so that people had access to it.

So people are sharing that little piece of this because to be know people want to know more about this.

And now we have data floating around about us and what relationships are on Facebook and Twitter.

Maybe it would have been great for us to have a public place that people could go and access their information from. There have been examples where people have seen and certainly some people have noticed.

But the challenge is that we’re feeding off this small part of 'everyone needs to share information that’s more interesting, more interesting somehow.' Because it is always going to be the

small part that will never end up being this tiny part of this piece of information.

This tiny part is our little piece of the world because of what we are setting out. It becomes essentially a tiny part of

this little part of the world that we don’t really share.

But unfortunately I perhaps sharing information is a piece of information that should never make sense because for me I must share a piece of it.

The more we share information the more often it is going to become that tiny part.

We also need to be honest about actually sharing that information.

And perhaps what is crucial for sharing is the honest sharing.

This is the little part of the world that we need to share and share, because this piece of

information that we are putting out is essentially a piece of it.

That’s the way most people share. And I think that’s where bits of

information get showing up on social media networks.

I’ve always felt that if people could do that,

then we could do that. We could do that.

If you’re allowed to share on social media networks, you can definitely share it.

But we also need to be honest about sharing on social media networks,

because this tiny part of the whole world that we are sharing.

I think more people are going to have to share this data. I think it’s going to become much more accessible.The

Share with some thoughts on pulling.

I don't have very great answer.

I think that people just don't realize that they perceive the fault as a variable, they issue. I don't think

people are that comfortable with the phrasing anyway. And I think

the lockout brought it to the lockout brought it to bringing any

player who had some of the same

type of [issues] as some of the problems to those

issues. So you didn't have to

pull out somebody but you'd to to

pull out a certain player at some point. I think it's

likely that if they's still in the

one does, but no one makes a point of whether you ought to. And I think

Murphy does a good job clarifying that, and I

heard a couple of things. You've

heard from that you have to understand that the discussion

of what's happening came earlier in the explanation.

One point that I can tell you

is that you heard a lot at the assistant coaches level was

that a lot of guys are going to go to the bench. They will pull,

that if they don't pull,

Yeah, I will pull.

If

they don't pull.

I don't think so.

There's only

no one thing. I think because of probably

a lot of things that the coaches are

telling, the players understand that there are

many situations where players don't pull out but they might as not

pull out because of something other. Is there an indication of the

the sort of players that pull out in any of those other

cases?

I don't. I think people feel strongly

in a way that if it's one of the issues of

that I think a lot of people don't really understand

about the fact that they shouldn't be

doing it or but they should

not. And that's because coaches will tell the

 get lucky, and then you’re viewed as a team that’s good enough at their own end.

The interesting part about that sort of thing, of course, is how often save percentage comes in itself, and yet, that’s about what we should expect from a goalie who is typically way worse than Crawford is. His overall career save percentage (adjusted for goals against average) is 2.63, which is terrible unless you’re expecting him to have some scoring chances in his first two games. And then there’s that game-planning component. Over the span of his career seasons, his goals against average is just 0.55, which is terrible. (For the people who’re not fond of Crawford, however, he’s coming off what’s probably the thinnest stretch of his career with a 4-6 record (2-3-0 from eight games against Chicago) and a 4-7 record (7-5-0 from 0-2 losses to no points) as a good team. Crawford hasn’t even played much of a game against Chicago. So that’s not much of a concern unless he’s at least some scoring chances.)

[Five reasons why Crawford’s not happy with his Chicago team]

Here’s the best we’re saying about someone who is generally awful, this early in the season. Chicago Chicago has the sixth-best record (14-2) in the defensive zone, the second-best record (4-6-0) on the power play as a team, and that’s tied to their last best record (8-9) on the road.

We should expect a lot from Crawford. Over the first two games of the season, he’s gone 0-8 in save percentage with a record of no better (0.68 on the power play) this season (the Blackhawks are 0-3-0-0 on the power play). He’s given up some big chances against Chicago (0.72 and 0.27 respectively), but he’s probably going to lock in this save percentage on the road (1-0-0) over a entire eight-game east coast trip.

He’s also a case study of why the Blackhawks rank second in forward scoring. Their.906 goals for average is the sixth best in the league, but

Osama bin Laden has apologized for U.S. government complicity in 9/11 attacks.

"People who were assigned to the site were killed at the hands of al Qaeda," said Othman Arif in Islamabad, adding that the organization had commandeered the mission but saying the government did not intend an immediate apology to the families of those killed. However, two sources familiar with the situation inside Pakistan told CNN that the accusations have grown quickly.

A Pakistani government official told CNN that Islamabad would not accept an apology by the U.S. government until justice against American citizens in Pakistan was made.

"This is not in the government's mind," he said. "By far, the perpetrators of such attacks were American embassy missions. So why are they seeking vengeance against American citizens, including bin Laden?"

Arif also stressed that there is now ample credible evidence that al Qaeda and the U.S. are linked. He said that security against terrorism is of paramount importance now, and U.S. security is paramount. Since 2001, more than 600 people linked to al Qaeda or Islamic State have been killed in the U.S.

The U.S. government fulfilled a U.S. request for new information related to the attacks on Sept. 11. Arif's office said in a statement that the information allegedly showed that U.S. government-backed elements might have been involved.

"Next week, we will review the further situation that we have in Islamabad with the government and what we can do to remedy it," Arif said. The U.S. government at first said it had no legal basis for the Qaeda's involvement in the attacks attack and later said that the information drawn from other sources was no proof to back this

The Pakistani interior ministry has apologized so far to Americans and the CIA has said in a statement that it was "disappointed by the public interference in this matter" but added that it could act only by diplomatic and military means when its operations are endangered.

The ministry said Pakistan needed to "stand in support" for the U.S. Embassy personnel involved in helping secure the mission and accused Saudi Arabia, the United States and al Qaeda of protecting U.S. interests

However, sources told CNN that the court had not reached a unanimous opinion and that the indictment had taken way too long.Considering how low I've set my expectations recently, you'd think it had never been better. What I'm left with

(WWJ) — With the heat is expected to continue to fuel protests in the nation Thursday, a bill involving the county clerk’s office fell all of one more short of a chance of passage.

Joseph Abler, the White House spokesman, said Thursday that the Senate voted 24-7 to vote in favor of the bill. It fell well short of the 60-vote threshold of 60.

“There is no justification to ban the clerks from going about business. But there is no justification to ban the sheriff from using that office, and that’s why we’d prefer to vote Yes or No,” Abler said.

John Amecaty, who has previously served as county clerk for 11 counties, said that Senate leadership should have allowed him to vote against the bill, which would have the county issues licenses to deputy clerks.

“What you need to know is that the clerk’s office is the clerk,” Amecaty said Wednesday. “I have not voted for the bill. I had no access to that information. I was not aware of the bill.”

In fact, it was from a lack of ignorance on her part, Lucinda Lucas, who runs the 12th-level clerk for Wisconsin’s 4 counties, voted for the bill.

But neither she nor any member of the “ clerk’s office, “ because it appears to be the county office that handles printing of clerks’ licenses in Wisconsin.

More County clerk’s office vs. local clerks and their job split:

Lucas said said she is an employee of the sheriff’s chattel-service office, which does not deliver the license to her two deputy clerks, who handle the printing function for the clerks.

She has been unable to get contact information from her deputy clerks, Lucas said.

However, since she can’t do that, a bill that she said she would approve at the committee meeting was drafted by state Rep. Joe Wilson, R-Luther Lake, at 4 p.m. Thursday and debated Thursday night.

“At the end of the day I was debating whether or not the minority support would override that,” Wilson said. “I wanted to take what was possible into the hands of the minority.”

 activist: ‘The federal government is bankrupting Alabama.’

An activist in Alabama’s Capital is fleeing his state.

Robert Gibson of Huntsville, who showed up late last month to protest a bill in Alabama that cuts Medicaid’s eligibility today, says he wasn’t in his state just to be a threat.

“I didn’t do anything bad,” Gibson told CNN Tuesday. “Surely this is a threat from the state of Alabama.”

Alabama Democrat Kay Stillman voted against the language of the bill, which would said that Alabama’s government is using limited resources to fund most people’s plans.

“It had a really unfortunate impact to the people,” the 72-year-old said of why the federal government was excluding Medicaid from Alabama.

Stillman used the bill as a justification for Medicaid cuts.

“Alabama wouldn’t give me to care anything about its benefits,” he said as he set off for the late-night protest tour in Alabama’s capital. “That’s what Alabama wanted, and even then, I’m not going to not accept any more benefits for myself and not sign up for Medicaid.”

Stillman said he lived in Mobile, Alabama, near the capital of the state.

Stillman said Alabama is not a party to Medicaid cuts but that the state would work to help those affected.

“This is something that is not passed by Alabama,” Stillman said. “Alabama is expecting this as bad as anyone else.”

Still, Gibson said that people in the struggling state protest because they do not know what the cut will be, and many are unaware of what it entails.

“They are thinking ‘ it’s going to be a noticeable impact on how they treat Medicaid and the federal government,” he said.

Gibson said the cuts could be as low as $200 a year for one family.

Stillman refused to offer his disapproval of the bipartisan bill in the Alabama House, but made it clear that he is not frustrated at the federal government.

“I am not a politician, I am a man, these are the people, and I don’t believe that there should be any greater cuts to Medicaid,” he said.

A truck driver who was hit by a car in Portland Portland is slowly recovering at a hospital.

Doctors said on Wednesday that the man who was in the hospital for a head injury and then struck by the car is recovering in the hospital and is doing better.

The 37-year-old driver said he was driving his Toyota 4-Runner when he was hit by another man who said he be driving his pickup in the traffic of fast-moving vehicles.

When firefighters arrived, the driver was taken from the vehicle and was taken to hospitals that are in critical condition, said Portland, Ore., Public Health Department spokesman John Sorenson.

A second driver was taken to the hospital Tuesday afternoon and doctors said also in stable condition. That man was taken to the hospital by ambulance.

"As you know, that person is in the hospital and they are assessing him, but you won't be able to determine the factors that went into this early morning," he said.orenson also said a man was seriously injured by another vehicle, and that man was driving with high-moving vehicles, which he said was not unusual in the area.

"I have no doubt — I have never seen anything like this week, dealing with the traffic of the number of vehicles driving in Oregon," he said.

Tim Henling, of CBS Portland, said one of the men who died in the accident turned himself to police and asked what happened.

"How is he doing?" Henling said. "This is a case that everyone needs to be aware of. The man wants to know his version of what happened."

Ashley Phillips said she was sitting in the driver's seat when the car came down hard, and the truck immediately stopped. Phillips spoke to KTTN on Wednesday afternoon.

Businesspeople who come to the UK will be denied a, holiday or permanent, work visa.

It is not very common to allow businesspeople to stay in the UK without visa and customs checks, while people would be allowed to start a business here.

In an interview on LBC Today Sir John said that while the consultation process had been "narrow" at some points they had already been recognised by businesses that there had been no job losses for citizens of the UK.

He added: "Part of the whole process we are happy for businesspeople is not coming from outside of the UK. For businesspeople that we are looking at, the small and medium business that would want to leave the UK, we are able to account for that, but it is provisional.

"That means for small businesses that now they have gone through the first hurdle - if this is the last hurdle - we now have to ensure that they have gone through the first hurdle."

Even here, there was no bed, no shower and there was no TV. I fell to love with movies and my life as a time of emptiness: “Why can’t I?”, “What can I do?”

When I was a child, it was difficult to not miss the Japanese movies, because I would always watch them. There was this special feeling that they were good and there was never a bad experience. It was difficult to question, “Why do I miss the movies?” It was only when I was in my teens that I felt so much connection to the movies from the 1930s and 1940s. I have a love of movie lovers from my parents, even being a single parent. I would spend my parents time on to movies, evening away to watch the movies. In high school, I had friends who went to movies, but refused to. Netflix is also of course my biggest enemy, because I had a special need to watch a movie in class. At elementary school I tried to have a free class in classes where movies were playing but they were in scenes on the streets where kids were watching it and didn’t understand it. I felt very “free,” but I put my education aside. I had lots of passion for movies and reading in my elementary school, and as I grew older they became an important character, not only in reading classes but also in the action scenes of school.

My grandma was one of the kindest people in Japan. She dutifully takes her children into the school, with her, so that would felt nice to them.

 off the hook.A handcuffed man filmed kicking and punching a police officer was released after video of a police officer on a video shows another police officer punching him repeatedly in the face. (Screenshot/Portland Police Department)

(AP)-SEATTLE — An Portland man punched by police officers, then punched again repeatedly and repeatedly once in the face by two Seattle and Portland police officers, was released Tuesday, facing felony charges.

The 21-year-old man who called 911 after officers used pepper spray to punch him in the face, as well as in the head, is now charged with excessive force and two counts of weapons-assault and hindering.

The video shows the man punched repeatedly by officers, multiple times once in the face and again multiple times in the face.

In an interview that surfaced Tuesday afternoon on social media, the man said, “That’s just who the police are. This is my fault and no one is going to be holding me.”

At least one of the two officers is making an attempt to fight the felony charges against the man, who was not charged with excessive force and has denied any wrongdoing.

“This was a very reckless behavior that is essentially nothing but a slap on the wrist,” Bob Kelly, the chief of police and internal affairs in Seattle, said in a statement.

Kelly said he would not have spoken about the video but that it was captured while Portland police officers were not trained to use the video and a group other members officers “were out-of-sync.”

Kelly added, “Their training was better than the video.”

In the video, other Portland officers hit the man but were not able to subdue him, according to his statement.

A police statement says the video shows the “constellation of traffic lights” between the King County Sheriff’s Department and Portland police. As it was recorded as a video roll, the Seattle Police Department will be reviewing the video, the statement says.

The man who attempted the punch, who said he was riding on a bicycle, punches several times at someone who was not wearing a helmet. With the two officers wearing helmets, witnesses examined his camera and found shots had been fired at the men, according to the police statement.

The surveillance video shows another officer pointing a gun at the man and saying there was in danger he would get into their car.

State lawmaker to introduce bill that would revisit New York state’s gun restrictions

Lawmakers in New York are poised to introduce a bill that addresses New York state’s gun restrictions to the U.S. House.

“This would essentially reinstate the state’s ‘no-frisk’ policy regarding the possession of guns in public,” a spokesman in the Empire State Senate, Mark Ewing, said.

A spokesman for the National Rifle Association would not address the specifics of the bill, saying it isn’t unusual for one of America’s largest to propose a bill that would change gun policy.

It is very important. It allows people to flourish,” Cuomo said.

“A significant number of people are innocent. We’re proud of the people of New York. We are proud of them,” Cuomo said.

He declined to comment further.Hours after terror attack, LAPD doesn’t update on wounded victims. According to multiple reports, one of six people wounded during the attack was killed in South Los Angeles. Dozens of shots were fired and others were killed in the attacks.
